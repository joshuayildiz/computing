=========

My adventures in computing.


Font
----

Berkeley Mono. Because I really like it and it makes my day looking at it.
Also I did pay for it.


Terminal
--------

Ghostty. Because it has really good input latency and comes with builtin themes.
Next to no config all. In fact here is the config I use:

```
font-family = "Berkeley Mono Variable Regular Retina"
theme = "Mariana"
font-size = 16
```


Password Manager
----------------

1Password because it also manages ssh keys and server info.
Now that I mention it I should probably clean that up...


Text Editor
-----------

Sublime Text because I did buy a license AND it is the most resource efficient
with really good input latency. Also I like how minimal it is and without latency
stuff.

Here is the config

```json
{
	// font
	"font_face": "Berkeley Mono Variable Regular Retina",
	"font_size": 16,

	// formatting
	"ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
	"scroll_past_end": true,
	"rulers": [80],

	// misc
	"auto_complete": false,
	"index_files": false,
	"create_window_at_startup": false,
	"animation_enabled": false,
	"sidebar_on_right": true,
}
```


Git GUI
-------

Sublime Merge because I really like the UI and did also pay for a license.


Database
--------

PostgreSQL bro are you mad? Why use another DB when that GORGEOUS thing exists??


Database UI
-----------

Table Plus is native and just consumes less battery with good input latency.
Plus it also gives me the opportunity to buy my next license.


Alfred
------

MacOS 26 just killed spotlight for me. I search for my apps and all I get is
items to either files or web searches. I JUST WANNA OPEN GHOSTTY FOR
CHRIST'S SAKE.
