============================

Finally got back my macbook from service.
Time to set it up.

I got 1password directly from the website and got macos cmdline
tools from the kind prompt reminding me I don't have git installed.

Let's get plan9port.

	sudo mkdir /usr/local/plan9
	sudo chown $USER /usr/local/plan9
	cd /usr/local/plan9
	git clone https://github.com/9fans/plan9port .

For some reason macos doesn't allow installing stuff to /usr/lib.
Let's also build everything while we are in.

	./INSTALL

This takes a while unfortunately. But anyway, let's add those to path.

	echo 'export PLAN9=/usr/local/plan9' >> $HOME/.zshrc
	echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$PLAN9/bin'  >> $HOME/.zshrc

I have conveniently put my zshrc to this repository. Go take a look.
Let's also copy some stuff to Applications folder for convenience.

	cp -r $PLAN9/mac/9term.app /Applications
	cp -r $PLAN9/mac/Plumb.app /Applications

With that, time to set up the font.
I got berkeley mono again.

	echo 'export font=/mnt/font/BerkeleyMonoVariable-Regular/12a/font' >> $HOME/.zshrc

And let's alias acme to use that too

	echo 'alias acme="acme -f /mnt/font/BerkeleyMonoVariable-Regular/12a/font"' >> $HOME/.zshrc

And with that our setup is done!

============================

Now time for a password manager.
I just use 1password normally from the repo but sadly void doesn't have it.
I'm using 1password-cli which is a single statically linked binary.
Just put it in bin.

Kudos to the dev team @1password.

============================

And now for the eye candy. We need a nice font!
I got berkeley mono lying around somewhere so I will just download
and put it in $home/.local/share/fonts and reset the font cache.

	fc-cache -r

And reset fontsrv

	kill $(pgrep fontsrv)
	fontsrv &

You can then ask fontsrv for a list of fonts.
Lets check if it exists.

	9p ls font | grep Berkeley

If you don't see it you did something terrible.

Next is actually telling the system to use that font.
Every plan9port program imports env vars from its parent process.
So setting font in xinitrc should do the trick for us:

	export font=/mnt/font/BerkeleyMonoVariable-Regular/10a/font

Also, set an alias for acme cuz for some reason acme doesn't work that way.

	alias acme='acme -f /mnt/font/BerkeleyMonoVariable-Regular/10a/font'

And now the font should work.

You may be wondering where /mnt came from since we are asking 9p to ls font directory.
As far as I can tell /mnt is symbolically where everything mounts unto.
So every program reads from that directory.

============================

Now that everything works, time to set up acme.
It needs two processes up. The font server and the plumber.
So prepend to $home/.xinitrc so that it looks like this:

	fontsrv &
	plumber &
	exec dwm

I've put my xinitrc in the repo if you wanna take a look.


Wed Dec 10 00:56:57 +03 2025
============================

I need a display manager. We have two contenders: X11 and Wayland.
Both suck to be honest but wayland sucks less so I wanna go with that.
But also dwm is X11-only so

	sudo xbps-install xorg dwm dmenu st

Then put

	echo 'exec dwm' > $HOME/.xinitrc

And start x11 with

	startx

Nice!


Wed Dec 10 00:10:22 +03 2025
============================

For utils I went with plan9port.
It is in the xbps repository so

	sudo xbps-install plan9port

This installs a lot of plan9 utils into /usr/lib/plan9.
Also I want common "build essentials" so

	sudo xbps-install base-devel git

Nice!

============================

Welcome to my adventures in computing.
I just installed void linux and wanted to share how it went.

Basically I grabbed and ISO file from https://voidlinux.org and burned it using rufus.
I chose musl libc because glibc codebase was horrible to look at.
I wanted a system that was very simple and stable.

After that the installation is pretty straightforward.
My only issue was with wifi since at setup it didn't connect.

You basically have to

	wpa_passphrase $SSID $PASSWORD | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Then edit the file so only your new config is present.
Then restart the wpa_supplicant service so it connects nicely.

	sudo sv restart wpa_supplicant

You can check the wifi connection with

	wpa_cli status

And test if it actually works with

	ping -c 1 google.com

You can then update the system

	sudo xbps-install -Syu
